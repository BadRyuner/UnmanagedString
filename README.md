# UnmanagedString
A simple tool for converting strings to unmanaged methods. Thanks to the power of [AsmResolver](https://github.com/Washi1337/AsmResolver), you can do this little trick.

## How does it work?
`UnmanagedString.exe <path to file>`
Via the command prompt or by dragging the file to be modified. Works with .NET Framework and .NET Core!
