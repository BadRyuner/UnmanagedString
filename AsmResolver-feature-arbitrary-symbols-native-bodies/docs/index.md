# AsmResolver

This is the documentation of the AsmResolver project. AsmResolver is a
set of libraries allowing .NET programmers to read, modify and write
executable files. This includes .NET as well as native images. The
library exposes high-level representations of the PE, while still
allowing the user to access low-level structures.
