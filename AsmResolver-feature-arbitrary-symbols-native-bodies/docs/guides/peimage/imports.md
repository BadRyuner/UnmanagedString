# Imports Directory

Most portable executables import functions and fields from other,
external libraries. These are stored in a table in the imports data
directory of the PE file. Each entry in this table defines a module that
is loaded at runtime, and a set of members that are looked up.

All code relevant to the imports directory of a PE resides in the
following namespace:

``` csharp
using AsmResolver.PE.Imports;
```

## Imported Modules and Symbols

The `IPEImage` interface exposes the `Imports` property, which contains
all members that are resolved at runtime, grouped by the defining
module. Below an example of a program that lists all members imported by
a given `IPEImage` instance:

``` csharp
foreach (var module in peImage.Imports)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Module: {module.Name}");

    foreach (var member in module.Symbols)
    {
        if (member.IsImportByName)
            Console.WriteLine($"\t- {member.Name}");
        else
            Console.WriteLine($"\t- #{member.Ordinal}");
    }

    Console.WriteLine();
}
```

## Import Hash

An Import Hash (ImpHash) of a PE image is a hash code that is calculated
based on all symbols imported by the image. [Originally introduced in
2014 by
Mandiant](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/01/tracking-malware-import-hashing.html),
an Import Hash can be used to help identifying malware families quickly,
as malware samples that belong to the same family often have the same
set of dependencies.

AsmResolver provides a built-in implementation for calculating the
Import Hash. The hash can be obtained by using the `GetImportHash`
extension method on `IPEImage`:

``` csharp
IPEImage image = ...
byte[] hash = image.GetImportHash();
```

Since the hash is computed based on the names of all imported symbols,
symbols that are imported by ordinal need to be resolved. By default,
AsmResolver uses a static lookup table for a couple of common Windows
libraries, but should this resolution process be customized, then this
can be done by providing a custom instance of `ISymbolResolver`:

``` csharp
public class MySymbolResolver : ISymbolResolver
{
    public ExportedSymbol? Resolve(ImportedSymbol symbol)
    {
        /* Resolve symbol by ordinal here... */
    }
}

IPEImage image = ...
byte[] hash = image.GetImportHash(new MySymbolResolver());
```

While the Import Hash can be a good identifier for native PE images, for
.NET images this is not the case. .NET images usually only import a
single external symbol (either `mscoree.dll!_CorExeMain` or
`mscoree.dll!_CorDllMain`), and as such they will almost always have the
exact same Import Hash. See [TypeReference Hash (TRH)](/guides/peimage/dotnet.html#typereference-hash-trh) for an alternative for .NET images.
